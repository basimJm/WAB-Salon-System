# WAB — Session Log

> Every task gets a block (template in `.claude/hooks.md` §3). Keep only the current and last few sessions here; move durable knowledge to `memory.md` and delete stale blocks.

## Current Session
- Started: 2026-10-12
- Goal: Set up repo-wide rules, roles, hooks, session and memory for Claude Code.

### Open / In Progress
- (none)

### Completed
### T-001 — Repo-wide Claude rules, roles, hooks, session & memory
- Project: repo root (`.claude/`, `CLAUDE.md`)
- Branch: `chore/claude-rules-hooks`
- Status: DONE
- Acceptance criteria:
  - [x] `.claude/rules.md` with token-efficiency, requirements and delivery rules (tests, branching, no-hardcode, 3 loops)
  - [x] `.claude/roles.md` with the four senior roles
  - [x] `.claude/hooks.md` + `.claude/settings.json` hooks enforcing branch, hardcode, tests and review rules
  - [x] `.claude/session.md` and `.claude/memory.md`
  - [x] `CLAUDE.md` imports all of them so every session reads them
- Tests: `python3 .claude/hooks/test_hooks.py` — 19 pass (QA findings fixed: guard false positives on flags inside commit messages and on other commands chained with git push; now strips quotes/heredocs and checks each shell segment, covered by tests)
- Loops: 3/3
- Review: PASSED (SE ✔, Mobile N/A, Architect ✔, QA ✔) — config/docs only; hooks covered by unit tests.
- Notes: Per-project rules to be added next (user will provide).

### T-002 — Delivery roadmap & shared integration workflow
- Project: repo root (`ROADMAP.md`, `INTEGRATION_WORKFLOW.md`, `CLAUDE.md`)
- Branch: `docs/roadmap-integration`
- Status: DONE
- Acceptance criteria:
  - [x] Phases P0–P6 with tasks split by track: SERVICE, SERVER, CUSTOMER, MERCHANT, ADMIN (+ INT/REL)
  - [x] Tracks can run in parallel; API integration is last (P5)
  - [x] Rule for unready dependencies: build against contract fixtures behind interfaces with config-switched mocks
  - [x] Shared integration workflow: contracts, mocks, dev/prod environments per project, CI/CD and promotion
  - [x] Linked from `CLAUDE.md`
- Tests: docs only (no source code); links and task IDs cross-checked against PRD screen IDs
- Loops: 3/3
- Review: PASSED (SE ✔, Mobile ✔, Architect ✔, QA ✔) — consistent with CLAUDE.md §4–5 and PRDs.

### T-004 — Consolidated business domain spec
- Project: repo root (`BUSINESS_DOMAIN.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `ROADMAP.md`)
- Branch: `docs/business-domain-spec`
- Status: DONE
- Acceptance criteria:
  - [x] One file describing the whole business for server schemas and logic
  - [x] All collections with fields, types, enums, indexes and relations
  - [x] Algorithms: completeness/state, open-closed, availability, pricing/deposit, booking creation, refunds, no-show, ratings, conflicts, subscriptions, payouts, deletion
  - [x] Booking state machine with actors, preconditions and side effects
  - [x] Permissions matrix, socket events, notification matrix, jobs, settings defaults, error codes, open assumptions
  - [x] Linked from `CLAUDE.md` and `ROADMAP.md`
- Tests: docs only; cross-checked against Customer/Merchant/Admin PRDs and Backend BRD
- Loops: 3/3
- Review: PASSED (SE ✔, Mobile ✔, Architect ✔, QA ✔) — consistent with PRDs; assumptions listed in §12.

### T-005 — WAB-Server project rules
- Project: `WAB-Server/` (`WAB-Server/CLAUDE.md`; links in `CLAUDE.md`, `INTEGRATION_WORKFLOW.md`)
- Branch: `docs/server-rules`
- Status: DONE
- Acceptance criteria:
  - [x] Mandatory reading: root rules + all `.claude/*.md`, `BUSINESS_DOMAIN.md`, Backend BRD, PRDs
  - [x] Business domain applied and double-checked (before coding and before push)
  - [x] Layered TS architecture route → middleware → controller → service → repository → schema
  - [x] Customer / merchant / admin modules separated; shared logic in `domain/`, helpers in `utils/`
  - [x] No hardcoding; static data in constants; tunables in settings
  - [x] Base success/error responses; AR+EN for every response
  - [x] Every error type handled, including unexpected and process-level errors
  - [x] Clean, reusable, readable, scalable; no duplication
  - [x] Response envelope aligned in `INTEGRATION_WORKFLOW.md`
- Tests: docs only (no source code)
- Loops: 3/3
- Review: PASSED (SE ✔, Mobile N/A, Architect ✔, QA ✔) — envelope change applied before contracts exist, so no client breakage.

### T-006 — WAB-Server task backlog
- Project: `WAB-Server/docs/WAB_Server_Tasks.md`, root docs
- Branch: `claude/busy-johnson-2rch94`
- Status: DONE (PR #5 merged)
- Acceptance criteria:
  - [x] One md file in WAB-Server listing every task to build the whole backend, each with status (TODO/PENDING/DONE...)
  - [x] PENDING only when blocked by owner info or another SDK/package; reason stated
  - [x] Tasks small, strict order, next task not started before previous merged to main, one branch per task
  - [x] Every BE/NFR/BER requirement and BUSINESS_DOMAIN section mapped to tasks
  - [x] Legacy WAB-Server/BRD.md flagged as superseded
  - [x] Linked from CLAUDE.md and ROADMAP.md; memory.md updated
  - [x] Aligned with `WAB-Server/CLAUDE.md` (layout, base envelope, typed errors, AR+EN, contracts rule); split rows SRV-004a, SRV-005a
- Tests: docs only (no source); coverage matrix script-checked (no missing BE/NFR/BER); `python3 .claude/hooks/test_hooks.py`
- Loops: 3/3
- Review: PASSED (SE ✔, Mobile N/A, Architect ✔, QA ✔) — docs only; consistent with Backend BRD, BUSINESS_DOMAIN and ROADMAP.
- Notes: Branch is the cloud-session pinned branch (exception to `<type>/<name>`); all later tasks use `feat/srv-NNN-*`. Next: SRV-001 after merge.

### T-007 — SRV-001 TypeScript strict project + lint/format/test + folder layout
- Project: `WAB-Server/`
- Branch: `claude/busy-johnson-2rch94` (cloud-pinned branch, restarted from `main` after PR #5 merged)
- Status: DONE (PR #6 merged)
- Acceptance criteria (BE/NFR: NFR-09, NFR-10, BG-8; BUSINESS_DOMAIN: none — tooling only; server rules §2, §4, §9, §10):
  - [x] `tsconfig` strict (+ noUncheckedIndexedAccess, noUnused*) and separate build config excluding tests
  - [x] ESLint blocks `any` and `console`; Prettier; Jest (ts-jest); scripts build/typecheck/lint/format/test
  - [x] Folder layout of `WAB-Server/CLAUDE.md` §4 exists, listed once in `src/constants/layout.ts`
  - [x] Tests prove layout, strict config and lint rules; typecheck/lint/format/build/test green
  - [x] No secrets; `.env.example` present (keys filled by SRV-002)
- Tests: `cd WAB-Server && npm test` — 19 pass; `npm run typecheck|lint|format:check|build` green
- Loops: 3/3
- Review: PASSED (SE ✔, Mobile N/A, Architect ✔, QA ✔) — tooling only; `npm audit --omit=dev` = 0 vulns (dev-only transitive moderate advisories via jest/istanbul, tracked for SRV-010 CI audit scope).
- Notes: Next after merge: SRV-002.

### T-008 — SRV-002 Config/env loader + `.env.example`
- Project: `WAB-Server/` (`src/config`, `src/constants/env.ts`, `.env.example`)
- Branch: `claude/busy-johnson-2rch94` (restarted from `main` after PR #6 merged)
- Status: DONE (PR #7 merged)
- Acceptance criteria (BE/NFR: NFR-01 secrets only in env, NFR-09; BUSINESS_DOMAIN: none; server rules §5):
  - [x] Env validated with a schema at startup; invalid/missing → `ConfigError` naming keys only (never values)
  - [x] No defaults for connection secrets (MONGODB_URI, REDIS_URL); non-secret defaults live in `constants/`
  - [x] `.env.<NODE_ENV>` merged under real env (real env wins); unknown NODE_ENV falls back to development
  - [x] Immutable typed `AppConfig`; `.env.example` lists every key, no values (test-enforced)
  - [x] No `.env*` files committed
- Tests: `cd WAB-Server && npm test` — 34 pass; typecheck/lint/format:check/build green
- Loops: 3/3
- Review: PASSED (SE ✔, Mobile N/A, Architect ✔, QA ✔) — `ConfigError` is a plain Error for now; SRV-004 may re-base it on `BaseError`. Later tasks add their keys to schema + `.env.example` (e.g. JWT, Firebase, S3, SMTP, gateway).
- Notes: Next after merge: SRV-003.

### T-009 — SRV-003 Logger with redaction + request id
- Project: `WAB-Server/` (`src/utils/logger`, `src/middlewares/requestId.ts`, `src/constants/logging.ts`)
- Branch: `claude/busy-johnson-2rch94` (restarted from `main` after PR #7 merged)
- Status: IN REVIEW
- Acceptance criteria (BE/NFR: NFR-08 structured logs + traceId, NFR-01 no sensitive data in logs; server rules §8 logs, §5 constants):
  - [x] Structured JSON logger (pino) at the configured level; every log object redacted before output
  - [x] Tokens, passwords, OTP, IBAN, card data removed; phone numbers masked (last 3 digits); key matching case/separator-insensitive; nested, circular and deep objects safe; input never mutated
  - [x] `requestId` middleware: reuses a well-formed `X-Request-Id`, else UUID; sets response header, `req.id`, child `req.log` (`traceId`); rejects oversize/odd/injection values
  - [x] All names/limits/placeholders in `constants/logging.ts`
- Tests: `cd WAB-Server && npm test` — 52 pass; typecheck/lint/format:check/build green; `npm audit --omit=dev` 0
- Loops: 3/3
- Review: PASSED (SE ✔, Mobile N/A, Architect ✔, QA ✔) — added `pino` and `express` 5 (+ `@types/express`) deps; `traceId` = `req.id` is reused by SRV-004a error responses. Message strings are not scanned (only object fields) — callers must not interpolate secrets.
- Notes: Next after merge: SRV-004.

### Pending (next)
- T-003 — Per-project rules for the remaining folders (customer, merchant, admin, packages) — awaiting user input.
- SRV-004 — next server task, start only after T-009 is merged (see `WAB-Server/docs/WAB_Server_Tasks.md`).
- INT-01 — Contracts v1 (`contracts/`) — first task of the roadmap.
