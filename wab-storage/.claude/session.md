## Integration status (one glance)
- Presign/confirm/CDN/signed URLs/variants behind `StorageProvider`; the server keeps its own S3 code until SRV-112 ← STO-010.

## Current task

### STO-003 — StorageProvider port + memory adapter
- Branch: `feat/sto-003-port-memory`
- Status: IN REVIEW
- Acceptance criteria: Port matching WAB-Server types, validation, magic-byte detection, judgeUpload, memory adapter, createStorage factory
- Tests: `npm run verify` green (typecheck, lint, format, jest coverage gate 100/95/95, build, package smoke, loop)
- Loops: 1/1
- Review: PASSED (SE ✔, Mobile N/A, Architect ✔, QA ✔) — port is a superset-compatible copy of the server interface (REJECTION adds EMPTY); keys unique across buckets
