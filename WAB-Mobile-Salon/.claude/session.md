# WAB-Mobile-Salon — Session

> Loaded on every turn while working in this folder. Keep the current task block + the last 2 blocks; move older blocks nowhere (git history keeps them). Next task: `python3 scripts/tasks.py next merchant`. Status changes: `tasks.py set <ID> <STATUS>`. Cross-project view: root `.claude/session.md` and `INTEGRATION.md`.

## Integration status (one glance)
- No code yet. MER-001 scaffolds from the customer template; rules copied in MER-003 (until then `WAB-Mobile-Customer/CLAUDE.md` applies).
- Will consume `/merchant/v1` (71 ops); 6 server gaps (SRV-129…134) block MER-042/043/049/050; MER-004 Firebase registrations = owner.
- Real-time booking requests: socket + FCM data message, Android overlay / iOS time-sensitive actions (MER-012, MER-028…030).

## Current task

- (none) — run `python3 scripts/tasks.py next merchant`; task branches start from `origin/merchant`.
